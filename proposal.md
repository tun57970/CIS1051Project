# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO Campus resource finder app

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO its a web or an app that could help students find various resources on campus, such as study spots, computer labs, gyms,etc..

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
TODO my project is a campus resource finder app that will make it simple for students to find crucial resources including study spaces, computer labs, dining halls, and other facilities. along with a filtering tool that lets users see only particular resources types ( such as quiet study areas, food alternatives, or fitness cneters), the  app will have map layout that shows the location of resources throught campus. In order to discover space more effectively, users will also be able to view occupancy statuses of popular areas in real-time or almost real-time such as the number of computer available ina a lab or the level of usage in a library. 
The program will be developed as a user-freindly mobile application or web-based platform, most like using reacy for web developed or flutter for mobile development to ensure cross-platfrom compatibility.
The overall goal of this project is to facilitate campus navigation and assist student in making the most of their time by locating appropirate study and activity locations without having to search far.
 
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable -
none

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO 
A good outcome for this project will be a functional app or web with map interface, location makrkers for key resources, and a database to store and retrive resource information!

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO- same as the above one 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO- same as the above one 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO I was always interested in coding I was never good at it and it was a bit challenging but in order to make this app I will utilize my resources and with the help of colleagues. We are all working on each others parts as thereâ€™s no specific parts we are assigned to.
